Prometheus MSSQL Exporter Docker Container
=============

Prometheus exporter for Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL). Exposes the following metrics

*  mssql_instance_local_time Number of seconds since epoch on local instance
*  mssql_connections{database,state} Number of active connections
*  mssql_deadlocks Number of lock requests per second that resulted in a deadlock since last restart
*  mssql_user_errors Number of user errors/sec since last restart
*  mssql_kill_connection_errors Number of kill connection errors/sec since last restart
*  mssql_database_state{database} State of each database (0=online 1=restoring 2=recovering 3=recovery pending 4=suspect 5=emergency 6=offline 7=copying 10=offline secondary)
*  mssql_log_growths{database} Total number of times the transaction log for the database has been expanded last restart
*  mssql_database_filesize{database,logicalname,type,filename} Physical sizes of files used by database in KB, their names and types (0=rows, 1=log, 2=filestream,3=n/a 4=fulltext(prior to version 2008 of MS SQL Server))
*  mssql_page_life_expectancy Indicates the minimum number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool on this node without references. The traditional advice from Microsoft used to be that the PLE should remain above 300 seconds
*  mssql_io_stall{database,type} Wait time (ms) of stall since last restart
*  mssql_io_stall_total{database} Wait time (ms) of stall since last restart
*  mssql_batch_requests Number of Transact-SQL command batches received per second. This statistic is affected by all constraints (such as I/O, number of users, cachesize, complexity of requests, and so on). High batch requests mean good throughput
*  mssql_page_fault_count Number of page faults since last restart
*  mssql_memory_utilization_percentage Percentage of memory utilization
*  mssql_total_physical_memory_kb Total physical memory in KB
*  mssql_available_physical_memory_kb Available physical memory in KB
*  mssql_total_page_file_kb Total page file in KB
*  mssql_available_page_file_kb Available page file in KB

Please feel free to submit other interesting metrics to include.

Usage
-----

`docker run -e SERVER=192.168.56.101 -e USERNAME=SA -e PASSWORD=qkD4x3yy -e DEBUG=app -p 4000:4000 --name prometheus-mssql-exporter awaragi/prometheus-mssql-exporter`

The image supports the following environments and exposes port 4000

* **SERVER** server ip or dns name (required)
* **PORT** server port (optional defaults to 1433)
* **USERNAME** access user (required)
* **PASSWORD** access password (required)
* **DEBUG** comma delimited list of enabled logs (optional currently supports app and metrics)

It is **_required_** that the specified user has the following permissions

* GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO <user>
* GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO <user>

Development
-----------

### Launch via command line

`
SERVER=sqlserver
PORT=sqlport<1433>
USERNAME=sqluser
PASSWORD=sqluserpassword
EXPOSE=webport<4000>
node ./index.js
`

To enable debugging set the environment variable DEBUG to app and/or metrics (DEBUG=app) 

for example:
`DEBUG=app,metrics SERVER=192.168.56.101 USERNAME=SA PASSWORD=qkD4x3yy node ./index.js`

### building and pushing image to dockerhub

`npm run docker:build`

### Launch a mock mssql server

`docker run -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e SA_PASSWORD=qkD4x3yy -p 1433:1433 --name mssql -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux`

To use a persistent storage include `-v /mypath:/var/opt/mssql/data`
